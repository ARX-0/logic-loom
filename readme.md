## Rules

- The Hackathon is for 2hrs.
- Maximum number of participants in a team is 2.
- There will be 2 question sets containing 5 questions each namely M, V(Matlab, Verilog).
- You have to pick a set among two. That will be your main set. The other will become your secondary set if you wish to attempt it.
- Solving a question from the main set fetches you 10 points and a question from the secondary set fetches you 5 points.
- You are allowed to answer the questions in the secondary set only after the main set is completely answered.
- Use only open-source tools for Verilog(Vivado, Icarus Verilog, etc.) and offline Matlab Software.

## Guidelines

- Whoever has scored the highest points are considered the winners.
- In case 2 teams get the same number of points if they have chosen the same main set, the winner will be chosen based on solution efficiency.
- For MATLAB questions you are allowed to use the help command and access documentation from within the app.
- If any individual is found searching the web and AI tools for answers they shall be disqualified.
- Codes and results should be submitted via Github, for Verilog submit both design file and testbench file.
